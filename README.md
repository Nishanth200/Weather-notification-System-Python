# Weather Alert System

This program checks the weather forecast for a specific location and sends a WhatsApp message if it's going to rain.

## How it Works

The program uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given latitude and longitude. It then checks the forecast for the next four instances and sends a WhatsApp message if rain is predicted.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install necessary libraries by running: `pip install requests pywhatkit`

## Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `'YOUR-API-KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key in the code.
2. Add the latitude and longitude of the desired location in the `weather_param` dictionary.
3. Replace `'YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER'` with the recipient's phone number in the `phone_no` field of `pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg_instantly()`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Update the configuration as mentioned above.
3. Run the Python script.

## Important Notes

- Ensure your API key, latitude, longitude, and phone number are entered correctly.
- The WhatsApp feature requires the user to have a verified WhatsApp Web session.

## Disclaimer

This code provides a basic example of utilizing weather data and messaging APIs. Use it responsibly and ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective services.
